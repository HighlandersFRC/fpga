CRITICAL WARNING: [Netlist 29-160] Cannot set property 'iostandard', because the property does not exist for objects of type 'pin'. [c:/vivado/oled_project/oled_project.srcs/sources_1/bd/zynq_1/ip/zynq_1_processing_system7_1_0/zynq_1_processing_system7_1_0.xdc:30]
Resolution: Modify the set_property command to apply the property on the correct object type. Since the property is being applied as a scoped constraint, ensure the proper connectivity of the object port objects can be translated into pin objects.
